# Known issues

An overview of bugs and limitations you may run into with Magento's GraphQL API:

## Cart-related mutations result in `Can not find cart with ID` or `Cart isn't active` errors

Affected Magento versions:

- `2.4.7`: fixed after 2.4.7-beta1
- `2.4.6`: all versions

This is caused by a regression which results in some GraphQL errors no longer
getting a category extension string (such as `graphql-no-such-entity`).
Normally, these errors are handling by automatically creating a new cart, but
without the proper error category this error-handling logic is nog triggered.

As a workaround, you can apply
[cart-error-category.patch](./patches/cart-error-category.patch).

## After adding a product to cart with custom options, options are not saved and/or retrieving the cart results in an error

Affected Magento versions:

- `2.4.7`: unknown, see below
- `2.4.6`: all versions

When adding a product to cart, custom options are not processed and saved
correctly, and can result in an error on the `Cart.items.errors.message` field
when subsequently retrieving the cart, if the product had required custom
options.

The observed error happens because no value is given for the non-nullable
`message` field, however the original error occurs due a required custom option
not being present on the cart item, as the custom options we not saved correctly
during the previous `addProductsToCart` call.

Note that although the relevant PR for this fix was merged, the fix seems to
have gotten reverted and is not present in 2.4-develop at the time of writing,
and may not be included in the final release of 2.4.7.

As a workaround, you can apply
[fix-custom-option-processing.patch](./patches/fix-custom-option-processing.patch).

## Adding products to cart with pre-existing items that are out of stock always results in an error

Affected Magento versions:

- `2.4.7`: fixed after 2.4.7-beta2
- `2.4.6`: all versions

This is due to an inconsistency between errors that are reported through the
`AddProductsToCartOutput.user_errors` field and those on the cart items, which
make it impossible to differentiate between errors cause by the product that was
being added, and those from pre-existing cart items.

As a workaround you can apply
[fix-cart-user-error-reporting.patch](./patches/fix-cart-user-error-reporting.patch).

## Bundle selection products are not shown due to their visibility setting

Affected Magento versions:

- `2.4.6`: all versions

The `BundleItemOption.product` GraphQL field is returned as `null` if the
product visibility is set to not be visible in the catalog (which you may not
want).

As a workaround you can apply the following patches:

- [fix-bundle-selection-visibility-catalog.patch](./patches/fix-bundle-selection-visibility-catalog.patch)
- [fix-bundle-selection-visibility-related.patch](./patches/fix-bundle-selection-visibility-related.patch)

## Custom attributes return an error when they have a null value

Affected Magento versions:
- `2.4.7`: all versions

In magento version 2.4.7 the custom_attributesV2 field was added to load custom attribute values for a product.
If a requested attribute value is null then Magento will return an error, since the value is required.

You can apply the following patch, which ensures that the attribute is filtered and no error is thrown.
[fix-error-returning-null-attribute-values.patch](./patches/fix-error-returning-null-attribute-values.patch)
